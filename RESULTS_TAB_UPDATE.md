# Results Tab Update Summary

## What Was Changed

Updated the **Results tab** to enhance history management functionality.

### Features Already Working ✅

The Results tab was **already showing the full detailed analysis** for each session, exactly as shown in the Analyze tab:
- Full `DetailedFeedbackView` with all analysis details
- Session history with date/time stamps
- Dropdown menu to switch between different analysis sessions
- Users can come back and view any previous analysis

### What Was Added ✨

**Clear All History Feature**

1. **Trash Button** (Top-left)
   - Red trash icon in the navigation bar
   - Disabled (grayed out) when there's no history
   - Tapping shows a confirmation dialog

2. **Confirmation Dialog**
   - Clear warning message: "This will permanently delete all X saved analysis results"
   - Shows exact count of sessions that will be deleted
   - "Cancel" button (default action)
   - "Clear All" button (destructive/red action)

3. **Complete Data Cleanup**
   When user confirms deletion, the app:
   - Deletes all `PhotoSession` entities from Core Data
   - Clears all related UserDefaults:
     - `LatestDetailedAnalysis`
     - `LatestAnalysisIsFallback`
     - `LatestRecommendationPlan`
     - `LatestAnalysisSummary`
     - `LatestPersonalizedTips`
     - `LatestAnnotatedImage`
   - Saves changes with animation
   - Resets the selected session

## User Flow

### Viewing Previous Analyses
1. Tap **Results tab**
2. See the latest analysis automatically
3. Tap the dropdown menu (top-right) to view other sessions
4. Each session shows:
   - Full detailed analysis
   - Date and time of analysis
   - All scores, feedback, and recommendations

### Clearing History
1. Tap **Results tab**
2. Tap trash icon (top-left)
3. Confirmation appears: "Clear All History?"
4. Review the warning message
5. Choose:

### After Clearing

## Technical Implementation

2. Added `@State private var showClearConfirmation = false` for dialog state
3. Created `clearHistoryButton` view component

5. Added confirmation alert with proper messaging
6. Implemented `clearAllHistory()` function that:
   - Deletes all sessions from Core Data
   - Clears all related UserDefaults
   - Handles errors gracefully
   - Updates UI with animation

## Safety Features

- **Confirmation Required**: User must confirm before deletion
- **Destructive Style**: "Clear All" button is red to indicate danger

## Benefits
