# Build Error Fix

## Error
```
/Users/nick/Desktop/glowup/glowup/PhotoAnalysisService.swift:71:19 Unterminated string literal
```

## Root Cause
This is an **Xcode caching issue**. The file is syntactically correct but Xcode is showing a stale error from its build cache.

## Solution

### Method 1: Clean Build (Recommended)
1. In Xcode, press **⌘ + Shift + K** (or Product → Clean Build Folder)
2. Wait for the clean to complete
3. Press **⌘ + B** to build again

### Method 2: Derived Data Clean (if Method 1 doesn't work)
1. In Xcode, go to **File → Workspace Settings** (or Preferences → Locations)
2. Click the arrow next to **Derived Data** path
3. Find the folder for your `glowup` project
4. Delete that folder
5. Restart Xcode
6. Build again (**⌘ + B**)

### Method 3: Nuclear Option
If both above fail:
1. Close Xcode
2. Open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
   rm -rf glowup-*
   ```
3. Restart Xcode
4. Build

## Verification

The file `PhotoAnalysisService.swift` line 71 is:
```swift
print("[PhotoAnalysisService] Failed to encode analysis for session \(session.id?.uuidString ?? \"unknown\")")
```

This is **perfectly valid Swift**. All quotes are balanced and properly escaped.

## Next Steps

After cleaning the build:
1. Build should succeed
2. Remember to add `AnalysisLoadingView.swift` to Xcode (see NEXT_STEPS.md)
3. Test the app with the new optimizations

**Note**: macOS file system is case-insensitive, so `/Users/nick/Desktop/glowup/` and `/Users/nick/Desktop/GlowUp/` refer to the same location.
