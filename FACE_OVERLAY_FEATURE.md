## 💬 **Conversational Feedback Examples**

### **Lighting Feedback:**
```
✨ Your lighting is excellent! You're using natural light coming 
from the front. Keep using this lighting setup—it's working beautifully!

📸 Your photo is Perfect.
```

or

```
⚠️ Your lighting needs some work. You're using artificial light 
coming from overhead.

💡 Overhead lighting can cast shadows under your eyes. Try positioning 
yourself so the light comes from in front or slightly above at a 45° angle. 
A window is your best friend!
```

### **Eye Color Feedback:**
```
👁️ You have beautiful brown eyes! Brown eyes are incredibly versatile 
and work with almost any color.

🎨 Your Seasonal Palette: **Autumn**

Your best colors are: Olive Green, Burnt Orange, Warm Brown, Deep Burgundy.

These colors will make your brown eyes absolutely shine in photos and 
in person!
```

### **Skin Tone Feedback:**
```
✨ You have warm undertones, which puts you in the **Autumn season**.

🌞 Warm undertones mean gold, peach, and yellow-based colors are your 
best friends. You'll glow in earthy tones, warm reds, and golden hues.

🚫 Colors to avoid: Icy Blue, Bright White, Neon Colors. These won't 
enhance your natural coloring as much.
```

### **Hair Color Feedback:**
```
💇 Your dark brown hair combined with your Autumn coloring creates a 
beautiful harmony.

Dark hair creates beautiful contrast. You can pull off bold, saturated 
colors that others can't!

💡 When choosing outfits for photos, consider how they complement your 
hair color. Avoid colors that are too similar to your hair—you want 
contrast to make both pop!
```
